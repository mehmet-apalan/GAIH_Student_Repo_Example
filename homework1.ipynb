        "1) Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. First, \"The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\". This definition belongs to Arthur Samuel but this is an olderand informal definition. Second, \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\". This definition also belongs to Tom Mitchell and this is more modern definition."

        "2) There are lots of differences between supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables. Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms are trained using unlabeled data. Supervised learning model takes direct feedback to check if it is predicting correct output or not. Unsupervised learning model does not take any feedback. These are the main differences between supervised and unsupervised learning. Let's give three examples of these. For supervised learning,\r\n",

        "3) Validation set is used to select proper parameters of the system. It is part of the training set. Test set is just used to test and say the accuracy of the system. So, alidation set is used for tuning the parameters of a model. Test set is used for performance evaluation. Validation set is usually used for parameter selection and to avoild overfitting. If your model is non-linear (like NN) is trained on a training set only, it is very likely to get 100% accuracy and overfit, thus get very poor performance on test set. Thus a validation set, which is independant from the training set, is  used for parameter selection. On the contrary, test test is only used to test the performance of a trained model. "

So, continuous variables are must be integer but discrete variables must not, they can be any numerical value. A probability distribution over discrete variables can be explained using a probability mass function (PMF). When working with continuous random variables, we explain probability distributions using a probability density function (PDF) instead of a probability mass function."
